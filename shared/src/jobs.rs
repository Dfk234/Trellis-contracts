//! Background worker framework for delayed and retryable work (Issue #35).
//!
//! Soroban contracts cannot spawn threads, so "background" here means
//! **ledger-driven**: a job is an on-chain record with a `due_ledger`, a
//! retry policy and a deterministic idempotency key, and a permissionless
//! [`run_due_job`] call advances at most one job per invocation. A crank bot,
//! a keeper service, or a developer running `stellar contract invoke` all use
//! the same entry point, so long-running and retryable work moves out of the
//! request path without adding an off-chain source of truth.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//!                    enqueue_job                run_due_job (handler Ok)
//!   (caller)  ───────────────────▶  Pending  ─────────────────────────▶ Succeeded
//!                                      │                                   │
//!                                      │ handler Err, attempts < max       │ JobReceipt written
//!                                      ▼                                   ▼
//!                                   Pending (next_attempt_ledger =      re-enqueue or
//!                                      now + backoff)                  reprocess returns
//!                                      │                               AlreadyCompleted
//!                                      │ handler Err, attempts == max
//!                                      ▼
//!                                DeadLettered  ─── requeue_dead_letter / discard_dead_letter
//! ```
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! - **One job per call.** Bounded work per invocation keeps fees predictable
//!   and avoids a single unbounded loop aborting on the instruction budget.
//! - **The retry policy travels with the job.** `Job.policy` is written at
//!   enqueue time, so a later config change can never change the retry
//!   behaviour of already-queued work (reproducible history).
//! - **Idempotency is keyed, not timed.** Every job carries a 32-byte
//!   `dedupe_key`. While a job is queued the key maps to its id, so a second
//!   enqueue returns the existing job instead of duplicating it; once the job
//!   succeeds the key maps to a [`JobReceipt`], so replays and crashes are
//!   safely absorbed.
//! - **Failure context is preserved.** A failed attempt records the contract
//!   error code, the ledger it happened on, the attempt count and the worker
//!   address, so a dead letter can be diagnosed without replaying the ledger.
//!
//! See `docs/WORKERS.md` for local development and operating instructions.
