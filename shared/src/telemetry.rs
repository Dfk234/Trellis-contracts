//! Structured observability primitives shared by every Trellis contract.
//!
//! Telemetry is emitted as Soroban contract events so that off-chain indexers
//! can build latency, failure-rate, and conversion dashboards without reading
//! contract storage. Every payload carries the same five structured fields:
//!
//! | field              | meaning                                                    |
//! |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `operation`        | low-cardinality operation name (see `CORE_OPERATIONS`)      |
//! | `actor`            | who triggered it — user, admin, contract, worker, or system |
//! | `result`           | `Success` or `Failure`                                      |
//! | `latency_ledgers`  | ledgers elapsed between start and finish                    |
//! | `correlation_id`   | caller-supplied id, or the ledger sequence when absent      |
//!
//! ## Sensitive values
//!
//! Telemetry payloads deliberately contain **no addresses, amounts, tokens,
//! secrets, or free-form text**. Failures are described by the operation name
//! and the caller-supplied correlation id; the contract error is returned to
//! the caller (and, where the contract already does so, published separately)
//! rather than copied into telemetry.
